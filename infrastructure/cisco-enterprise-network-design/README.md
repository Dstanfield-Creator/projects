# Cisco Enterprise Network Design

> A small-enterprise reference design built as a lab: multi-VLAN campus on Catalyst multilayer switches, a Cisco ASA at the edge, centralised DHCP and DNS, and the verification steps that prove each layer works.

**Category:** Infrastructure (lab design) · **Status:** Completed · **Platform:** Cisco Catalyst multilayer (core) and access switches, Cisco ASA edge, Windows Server for DHCP/DNS. Built and verified in a lab; model numbers in the excerpts are representative.

## Design goals

- Separate users, servers, voice, management and guest traffic into VLANs with policy between them.
- Route between VLANs at the core (SVIs), not at the firewall, so east-west traffic stays fast.
- Terminate the internet edge on an ASA with NAT, a default-deny inbound policy, and remote-access VPN.
- Central DHCP with relay from every VLAN, and internal DNS that the firewall and switches also use.
- Everything verifiable with `show` commands.

## Topology

## VLAN and addressing plan

| VLAN | Name | Subnet | Gateway (SVI) | Notes |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | MGMT | 10.10.10.0/24 | .1 | switch/ASA management, no user ports |
| 20 | USERS | 10.10.20.0/24 | .1 | DHCP, 802.1X-ready |
| 30 | SERVERS | 10.10.30.0/24 | .1 | static, DC/DHCP/DNS at .10 |
| 40 | VOICE | 10.10.40.0/24 | .1 | voice VLAN on user ports, QoS trust |
| 50 | GUEST | 10.10.50.0/24 | .1 | internet only, isolated by ACL |
| 99 | NATIVE | — | — | unused native VLAN on trunks |
| — | CORE↔ASA | 10.10.0.0/30 | — | routed point-to-point |

## DHCP and DNS

A Windows Server at `10.10.30.10` runs AD-integrated DNS and DHCP with one scope per VLAN (20, 40, 50), option 3 router = the SVI, option 6 DNS = itself, and option 150 for phones in the voice scope. Every SVI that serves clients carries `ip helper-address 10.10.30.10`, so one DHCP server covers the campus. The switches and ASA use the same DNS so names resolve everywhere.

## Verification

```
CORE# show vlan brief
CORE# show interfaces trunk
CORE# show ip interface brief | include Vlan
CORE# show ip route
CORE# show ip dhcp relay statistics     ! relays incrementing per VLAN
ACCESS-1# show port-security interface fa0/1
ASA# show nat
ASA# show conn count
ASA# packet-tracer input inside tcp 10.10.20.50 12345 8.8.8.8 443
PC(VLAN20)> ipconfig /all        ! gateway .1, DNS .10, lease from 10.10.20.x
PC(VLAN50)> ping 10.10.30.10     ! fails (guest ACL), while internet works
```

## Design decisions

- **Routing at the core, filtering at the edge.** SVIs keep server-to-user traffic off the firewall; the ASA only sees north-south.
- **Unused native VLAN on trunks** and `nonegotiate` to remove VLAN-hopping and DTP tricks.
- **Guest isolation by ACL at the SVI** rather than at the firewall, so guest traffic never touches the server VLAN even in transit.
- **Port-security + BPDU guard** on every access port as the minimum before 802.1X.
